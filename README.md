### this repository was meant to be deleted and archived forever for the reason above.

### but since it have continued to grow even though I didn't do anything I thought I might as well update it one last time and let it die in the state it was before CENSORED.com.

### I'm not updating anything on my own, any updated apps are from their official source _(the download links are updated to match this repository)_. 

### everything else is the way it was on 05/oct/23.

### my message, which was here before I deleted it, is in the end. to anyone who cares.

# Tweaked iOS Apps

**Tweaks injected into iOS apps.** _([changelog](https://github.com/purp0s3/Tweaked-iOS-Apps/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md))_

You can install these on jailed 14.0-17.0 devices using [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).

You also can sideload these with [**Sideloadly**](https://sideloadly.io/), [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), [SideStore](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore) or your preferred sideloading service. **Sideloadly is recommended.**

Installing these via TrollStore should make push notifications work on all apps. _and local song importing on Spotify_

Sideloading, you'll only get push notifications using a paid developer account. _not sure about local song importing on Spotify_

**All .ipas tested on an iPhone 12 running iOS 17.0. Installed via TrollStore and sideloaded via Sideloadly.**

# Notes

**ALL CREDITS GOES TO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE TWEAKS, SUPPORT THEM.** The only thing I'm doing is injecting the tweaks into .ipas so that unexperienced users can use them easily.

Developers of these tweaks, if you don't want me to host an .ipa with your tweak injected, contact me and I'll delete it immediately.

All tweaks were injected using [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule), [Theos](https://theos.dev/) and [Theos Jailed](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed).

All tweaks were obtained within their GitHub repos or by fetching .debs via their cydia repos using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload).

All apps were obtained, downloaded and decrypted by myself.


# Donation

If you want to make a donation to me (I don't think I deserve it, but if you really want to), you can do that by clicking the donate button. Also, it will show to my parents that all the sleepless nights had a... purpose. [Donate by clicking in this beautiful and long hyperlink](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=G56V3FR2QEAQ8&no_recurring=0&item_name=Making+me+a+donation+allows+me+to+keep+seeking+my+purpose.&currency_code=USD).

# message

### If CENSORED.com uses my files without proper credits again I'm stopping this project forever. (05/october/2023)

I'm a dev student who has not much money, not much mental health, no spare time, 

YET, 

made this project to learn more about iOS coding and specially to help the jailbreak/sideloading community by releasing modified .ipa files

no complex work for end users, just read it all and click the download link!

---

I tried contacting them by e-mail, no response whatsoever. Nice way to quietly say ____ ___!

It's not about the money. 

All the time put into this repo, I got 2 **highly** appreciated donations. But the messages, they kept coming here and on Reddit. 

People were actually using this, sharing this, I was being helpful to others.

### What I don't like tho is being used.
